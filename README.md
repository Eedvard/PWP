Following commands will create the database and fill it with example data. All the necessary files are found on the requirements.txt file.

#create database 

db.session.add(nutri)
db.session.add(ingredient)

db.session.add(shoplist)
db.session.add(shoplisti)

db.session.commit()
```
The testing is done with pytest. db_test.py file is put into the same folder as the database app and ran by typing pytest into the terminal. The test will create the database and check that the relationships work properly. Then it will test that editing models will work properly with foreign keys. Then it will test the same but with removing the models.
